# Where The Party At - Backend

## Description

This is the backend of Where The Party At, the event management app. Built initially on MongoDB, Express, and Node.js as part of the MEAN stack using Angular as the frontend framework. I later decided to pick up Firebase for hosting, authentication, and database to test it out and learn more about it, so this backend repo contains the original version of it. Please see the frontend repo where you can see the app working here: [Capstone - Where The Party At - Frontend Repo](https://github.com/cwon07/capstone_frontend).
